# Python supports common numeric types including integers, floats, and complex numbers.
# Use the underscores to group numbers for the large numbers.

x = 5
y = 10.23
z = x * y
print(z)

# To make the long numbers more readable, you can group digits using underscores, like this:
count = 10_000_000_000
print(count)
